Thank you for NuGet'ing Northwoods Software's GoDiagram for .NET Windows Forms.

This full featured evaluation does not have a time limit, but there is a

This NuGet Package includes the DLL libraries and XML files for Intellisense.

DLLs included:

Northwoods.Go               the base library
Northwoods.Go.Draw          UI controls for Pen, Brush and Font setting
Northwoods.Go.Instruments   Dials, Knobs, Meters, etc
Northwoods.Go.Layout        Automatic Graph Layout

Northwoods.Go.Svg           SVG file generation from diagrams
Northwoods.Go.Xml           XML save / restore 

Only Northwoods.Go is required, the others are optional based on your needs.

GETTING STARTED

To add the GoDiagram controls to your Visual Studio ToolBox:
   - Right click in the Toolbox and choose "Add Tab" and name it "GoDiagram Win"
   - Drag and drop Northwoods.Go.dll from the solution's 
     packages\Northwoods.GoWin.5.0.0\lib\net<version> folder to the new tab.
   - Now you can drag GoView to your application Design

FULL INSTALL KIT ALSO AVAILABLE

We also have a .MSI Windows Installer kit.  This "full kit" includes
source code samples, documentation and Visual Studio integrated API Help files.
